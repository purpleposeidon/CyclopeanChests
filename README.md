# Cyclopean Chests

Chests, the way they used to be.

So far as I've found, there aren't any compatibility issues with chests from other mods.

1. Railcraft metal/void chests
2. Erebus chests
3. Cart chests (w/ railcraft installed, anyways.)


The enderchest could possibly use a better texture.

There's a seam on the top of double-chests because I'm pretty sure how it worked back then.
